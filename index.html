    <h2>Using Blogs in the Classroom</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Blogging	can	improve	students’s writing skills and build their confidence as writers. By blogging, students can take ownership of their writing, become	better observers of other's writing, and develop a more immediate and powerful understanding of audience. Blogs encourage experimenting and risk-taking, seriousness and play,	and	they foster	an increased awareness of private and public writing. Blogging blends both the freeing aspect of short pieces that can be written in a relatively low-stakes environment with the sense	of claiming	one’s own voice	and	learning how to	develop	analysis and articulate	ideas to a larger public. Guided by	clear expectations of what is required in a	class blog,	students can see their writing develop over	the course of the term. This handout describes strategies for using blogs as a writing tool in the classroom.</p>

        <h3>General Consideration</h3>
        <p>Although	at first it	may	seem somewhat daunting when	considering	the	perceived technical skills involved, using blogs in	the	classroom can be very rewarding. The learning curve	is not as steep	as you may imagine,	and	many resources for instructors(see <b>Tech	Support</b>	section	below) exist on	campus. Also, some students	when learning to navigate the platform initially may resist blogging. But most students	change their minds as they begin to	blog.</p>
        <h3>Empowering Students</h3>
        <p>Students	are	used to	writing	and	communicating in the digital landscape whether it be Twitter, FaceBook,	Tumblr,	or email. While	reading	their fellow student's blogs and comments, and responding online with their	own	comments, students recognize the value of clarity and what makes for strong	and	engaging posts. Students have the opportunity to practice writing and analytical skills	in their own blogs that	will transfer into essays and other	writing	endeavors. Students	are able to	see	their own writing as something “real” with a practical application. Creating a blog	can	be a bridge	for	students between the familiar digital world	and	what is being asked	of them	in academic	essays,	projects and other university-based	assignments. Blogging can be seen as a gateway experience for students who will	likely be using	digital	technologies and media in their	future endeavors regardless	of their discipline.</p>
        <h3>Possible Uses for Instructors</h3>
        <p>You may use blogging	for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>communicating announcements	and	assignments	in a format	that students may perceive to be more “friendly” than CTools</li>
            <li>sharing	instructor-generated exercises or prompts</li>
            <li>Community building</li>
            <li>creating a public place	where student work can be “published”</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Possible Uses for Students</h3>
        <p>Students may	use	blogging for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>responding to readings</li>
                <li>maintaining	a writer’s notebook	or journal</li>
                <li>posting	personal, reflective, exploratory, or open entries(campus observations,	“where I’m from,” pictures from	home, or favorite book or piece	of writing)</li>
                <li>sharing	student-generated research or links	to class-related articles</li>
                <li>exploring	visual	rhetoric</li>
                <li>practicing	writing	</li>
                <ul type="circle">
                    <li>developing	voice</li>	
                    <li>working	on	titles,	conciseness</li>
                    <li>considering	tone</li>
                    <li>brainstorming,	drafting,	facilitating	peer	review</li>
                </ul>
                <li>creating a showcase for final projects</li>
                <li>crafting an on-line image or presence</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>In Practice: Choosing A Platform</h3>
        <p>Several user-friendly blogging platforms	are	commonly used in classrooms. No	one	platform is	better suited to a specific discipline. Mostly the choice depends on your comfort level	and	 personal preference when trying out each platform.	For	example, <b>Tumblr</b> (tumblr.com) works well	for sharing	images,	quotes	or	brief	chunks	of	text,	or	consolidating	and	linking	to	other sites. Google’s	<b>Blogger</b>	(blogger.com) is one of	the	flagship blogging platforms;	it	is	intuitive	and	easy to	start up, and allows for flexibility with color	palettes and multiple fonts. Blogger and WordPress are both	supported at the University	by     
<a href="http://www.lsa.umich.edu/iss"><b>Instructional	Support	Services (ISS)</b></a>,	the	<a href="http://www.lsa.umich.edu/lrc/"><b>Language	Resource Center	(LRC)</b></a> and <a href="http://www.lib.umich.edu/knowledge-navigation-center"><b>MLibrary’s	Knowledge	Navigation	Center	(KNC)</b></a>. </p>
        <h3>A Word About WordPress</h3>
        <p><b>WordPress</b>	(wordpress.com)	is	an	all-purpose	platform	with	multiple	free	design	templates (“themes”)	and	high	capacity	for	text,	images, and	video.	Faculty	and	students	appreciate	the	extensive	how-to	support	features	and	video	tutorials	available	on	the	WordPress	site. If	you	are	considering	what	platform	to	use	in	your	classroom,	the	<b>ISS	Learning	Technologies	&	Consulting Group	(ISS-LTC)</b>	offers	this	advice:	“WordPress	is	the	most	commonly	used	content	management	system	(CMS)	in	the	world,	so	there's	a	fairly	good	chance	that	students	will	use	it again	later	in	their	lives,	for	blogging	or	just	hosting	a	website	of	any	sort. Both	Blogger and	WordPress	allow	for	text,	images	and	video;	for	instructors,	a	better	distinction	might	be	that WordPress	allows	for	sorting	posts	by	author,	which	Blogger	doesn't	(currently).” <br><br>Both	the	ISS-LTC	and	the	KNC	are	able	to	provide	support	to	faculty	as	you	prepare	to	teach blogging	and	other	new	media;	both	also	are	available	to	work	with	students	in	an	instructor’s classroom,	workshop	or	computer	lab	settings.	For	more	information,	please	see	the	<b>Tech Support	section</b>	below.<br><br> For	additional	support,	access	the	following	documents:	<b>Supplement	1:	“Using	WordPress”</b><br>(Lauren	Atkins,	Instructional	Technology	Consultant)	and	<b>Supplement	2:	“Blogging	Basics” </b><br>(Charlotte	Boulay,	creator	of	Sweetland’s	“Rhetoric	of	Blogging”	course).</p>
        <h3>Private, Classroom-Only, or Public</h3>
        <p>You	may	find	it	useful	to	talk	with	a	consultant	at	ISS-Learning	Technologies	&	Consulting	Group (ISS-LTC)	about	what	might	best	fit	your	classroom	needs	when	deciding	about	whether	to	make classroom	blogs	private,	classroom-only	or	public	(and	to	what	extent	public—for	example, searchable	by	search	engines	or	not). Please	see	<b>Tech	Support</b> section	below	for	more information. A	class	blog	or	individual	student	blogs	could	be	completely	private	and	classroom-based,	with the	only	users	and	viewers	being	you	as	the	instructor	and	your	enrolled	students.<br><br>	A	class	blog also	may	be	completely	public	and	accessible	to	anyone	online.	The	benefit	of	making	a	site public	is	that	it	creates	a	broader	sense	of	audience	and	of	participating	not	only	in	the	university	community	but	perhaps	a	global	community	as	well. However,	if	the	site	is	public,	be	aware	of	copyright	issues	when	posting	articles	or	class	readings;	CTools	is	a	more	secure location	for	sharing	copyrighted	material. </p>
        <h3>Generating and Facilitating Effective Blog Conversations</h3>
        <dl><dt>A	strong	blog	discussion	relies	on	clear	expectations	about	the	purpose	of	the	blog	and	the	nature	of	student	participation	on	it,	judicious	instructor	participation,	a	sense	of	interpersonal	community,	and	strong	blog	assignments/prompts.	What	follows	is	a	little	advice	about	each	of	these	components:
            <br><br>
            <dd><i>Clear	expectations</i>: Students	thrive	most	in	blog	conversations	when	they	understand	from	the	beginning	what	the	purpose	of	the	blog	is	(i.e.	what	they’re	meant	to	achieve/learn	from	their	participation	in	the	conversations	there)	and	what	your expectations	for strong	posts	and	useful	comments	are.</dd>
            <dd>
                <ul>
                    <li>It’s	a	good idea	to	talk	with	your	students	about	what	you	want	to	achieve	on	the	blog.</li>
                    <li>Providing	clear	guidelines	(whether	you	create	them	yourself	or	in	collaboration with	your	students)	about	what	makes	an	excellent	post	or	comment	goes	a	long	way	toward	generating	useful	conversations.</li>
                    <li>Rubrics	have	the	benefit	of	laying	out	your	expectations	as	well	as	helping	students assess	their	own	work,	especially	if	you’re	grading	the	blog.</li>
                </ul>
            </dd>
            <dd><i>Strong	Blog	Assignments/Prompts</i>: Decide	how	you	want	the	students	to	use	the	blog,	and	then	design	the	assignment,	and/or	individual	prompts,	accordingly.	Your	prompts	should	address	matters	of	both	content	and	timing:	</dd>
            <dd>
                <ul>
                    <li>Content	- Do	you	want	them	to	be	using	the	blog	to	chronicle	their	learning	in the	course,	like	handwritten	learning	journals	have	done	in	the	past?	Do	you	want	them	to	be	logging	their	research?	Sharing	resources	with	the	class	or	a peer	group? Posting	conversation	questions?	Conducting	close	readings	on	small	portions	of	the	texts?	Something	else?	Be	explicit.	Even	if	you want	to	give them	plenty	of	leeway	to	determine	what	to	say,	you	need	to	be	clear	about	  what	they’re	aiming	to	accomplish. For	example,	if	you	want	them	to	use	the	blog	to	reflect	on	course	readings,	it’s	probably	not	enough	to	say	that.	It’s	more helpful to	give	them some	guidance	on	how	to	reflect.	Do	you	want	their	gutlevel	reactions?	Do	you	want	them	to	analyze	the	rhetoric?	Do	you	want	them to	make	connections	between	the	reading	and	their	lived	experience?</li>
                    <li>Timing	– Do	they	need	to	post	weekly?	Bi-weekly?	Some	other	interval?	Or	do	they	just	need	to	post	a	certain	number	of	times?	Do	they	need	to	comment	on	peers’	posts?	If	so,	how	many,	and	how	often?	If	you	are	having	them	comment	on	each others’	posts,	it	can	be	helpful	to	stagger	when	they	post	versus	when they	comment.	That	way	they	can	focus	on	taking	one	role	at	a	time.	This	method	also	has	the	benefit	of	pacing	for	you	as	a	reader.	One	way	to	facilitate	this	is	through	blog	groups,	which	are	discussed	below.</li>
                </ul>
            </dd>
            <dd><i>Instructor	Participation</i>: A	good	balance	between	facilitating	and	controlling	the	blog	can	motivate	your	students	to	participate	most	productively.	Research	shows	that	instructor	prominence	or	high	activity	can	stifle	student	participation. </dd>
            <dd>
                <ul>
                    <li>Let	your	students	know	ahead	of	time	what	your	level	of	visibility	on	the	blog will	be	(and	why!)	as	well	as	how	much	directing	you’ll	do	while	you’re	there.	</li>
                    <li>If	you	check	in	regularly	and	respond	in	positive	ways	(“cheerleading”	strong	posts	and	following	up	with	questions	that	encourage	ever	deeper	thought),	your	students	will	be	more	likely	to	engage	with	purpose.</li>
                    <li>Step	in	enough	that	students	know	that	you’re	following	and	valuing	their	work,	but	not	so	much	that	they	rely	on	you	for	keeping	the	conversation	going.	</li>
                </ul>
            </dd>
            <dd><i>Interpersonal	Community</i>:	A	sense	of	shared	purpose	and	mutual	care	can	mean	the	difference	between	a	lackluster,	superficial	conversation	and	a	dynamic	interactive	space.	
                <dd>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Having	students	address	each	other	by	name	in	their	posts	and	comments	can instill	a sense	of	responsibility	to	and	familiarity	with	each	other.	</li>
                        <li>Invite	them	to	each	cultivate	their	own	voices	on	the	blog,	leaning	into	their individuality	and	personality	while	engaging	with	the	material.	</li>
                        <li>Blog	Groups	- Many	instructors	assign	small	groups of	students	(3-4	in	a	smaller	class,	a	maximum	of	10	in	a	larger	class)	to	blog	groups	who	post	and	comment	for	each	other	for	a	set	period	of	time—sometimes	all	semester,	sometimes	for	the	length	of	a	unit,	etc.,	depending	on	your	course	structure	and	preference.	This	has	the	benefit	of	helping	students	get	to	know	each	other’s	ways	of	thinking,	writing	style,	and	learning	processes	in	more	detail.	It	also	helps	to	reduce	the	potential	stress	for	you	of	responding	to	the	entire	class’s	posts	every	time,	while	ensuring	that	all	students	always	receive	some	comments	on	their	posts.</li>
                    </ul>
                </dd>
            </dd>
        </dt></dl>
        <h3>Class Blog and Individual Student Blogs</h3>
        <p>There	are	many	ways	to	use	blogs	in	the	classroom. Some	instructors	choose	to	create	a	class	blog	that	all	enrolled	students	can	contribute	to	by	adding	comments	or	by	making	individual	posts.	Here	is	a	screenshot	of	a	<b>class	blog</b>	from	WRITING	200	– winter	2013.</p>
        <img src="image1.png" alt="Image">
        <p>A	class	blog	can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>unite	all	class	announcements,	assignments,	and	exercises	in	one	space	or	hub	with	the	instructor	as	the	operator	of	the	site</li>
            <li>provide	a	workspace	for	students	to	share	thoughts,	drafts,	or	projects	in	a	relatively low-stakes	environment</li>
            <li>provide	a	venue	for	quieter	students	to	“speak”	and	contribute	ideas</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Below	is	an	example	of	a	<b>student	contributor	“post”</b> from	WRITING	200	responding	to	the instructor’s prompt.</p>
        <img src="image2.png" alt="Image"><br>
        <p>Some	instructors	create	a	class	blog	and	ask	that	each	student	also	create	an	individual	blog. Here	is	an	example	of	a <b>class	blog	with	individual	student	blogs</b> from	English	225	– winter	2013.</p>
        <img src="image3.png" alt="Image">
        <p>An	instructor’s	class	blog	can:        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>serve	as	a	focal	point	for	writing	exercises,	models	and	prompts</li>
            <li>communicate	useful	classroom	information,	announcements,	online	links	and	readings</li>
            <li>include	links	to	all	the	individual	student	blogs	in	a	comprehensive	list	so	that	students can	easily	find	each	other’s	sites	for	reading,	commenting	or	peer-reviewing </li>
        </ul>
        <!-- <p style="text-align: center;">***</p> -->

        <img src="image4.png" alt="Image">
        <p>A	student	blog	can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>provide	a	workspace	for	assignments,	brainstorming,	process-oriented	activities	and	questions	of	design	and	visual	rhetoric</li>
            <li>help	students	develop	a	sense	of	audience,	voice	and	ownership</li>

        <h3>Setting Up Individual Student Blogs</h3>
        <p>It	may	be	helpful	for	you	to	create	a	course blog	before	class	begins;	you	then	can	use	your	site as	a	model	as	well	as	for	other	pedagogical	purposes.	Here	are	three	possible	options	for	set	up: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>before class meets, send material (<b>Supplement 1: “Using WordPress”</b>) to the class and ask that students set up their accounts and sites before the first class session [For more information, consult<b> Supplement 5: Getting Students Ready to Blog.</b>]</li>
            <li>during class time, teach the students how to set up the site</li>
            <li>during class time or outside of class time, invite ISS-LTC or KNC to hold a workshop for creating a blog</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Tech Support</h3>
        <p>You	will	find	a	broad	range	of	support	exists	for	faculty	choosin	to	include	blogs	in	their courses.	Some	important	university	resources	are	explained	below.</p>

        <h3>Notes on Blogging in the Classroom        </h3>
        <dl><dt>In	faculty	meetings,	many	instructors	have	commented	on	how	amazed	they	are	about	the	quality	of	the	writing	and	analytical	thinking	when	students	have	the	opportunity	to	use	blogging	as	a	medium.	Instructors	were	able	to	see	how	strengths	could	be	identified	in	the	informal	blog	posts	or	comments	and	then	were	able	to	help	students	transfer	these	strengths	to	other	academic	writing. Here	are	several	instructor	comments	that	address	the	benefits	of using	blogs	and	offer	thoughts	about	how	their	classroom	blogging	could	be	improved	in	the	future.
            <br><br>
            <dd><i>“It’s	often	very	useful	(not	to	mention	a	real	pleasure)	to	read	student	writing	in	a	different,	more	personal	voice.	It’s	easy	to	see	how	some	students	are	stymied	by	their	perceived expectation	of	a	“formal,”	“academic”	tone,	when	in	fact	they	have	a	well-developed	and	engaging	voice	in	the	blog.”</i> </dd>
            <br>
            <dd><i>“One	thing	I	learned	about	blogs:	reading	discussion	blogs	or	class	blogs	are	better	with prompts	or	questions	provided	by	me. Asking	them	to	just	write	something	in	response	to readings	causes	them	too	much	and	they	write	very	little.”</i></dd>
            <br>
            <dd><i>“One	thing	I	really	loved	about	blogs	was	the	opportunity	to	have	students	blog	about their writing	process	while	it	was	going	on. I	had	a	separate	blog	just	for	blogging	about	process	and	gave	them	a	few	prompts	to	respond	to. This	really	created	community	between	students	as	they	shared	their	struggles	in	progress. I	found	it	was	important	to	have	a	set	number	of	blog	posts	required	(4)	and	clear	deadlines	for	completing	them.”</i></dd>
